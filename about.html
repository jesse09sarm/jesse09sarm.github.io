    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
    <p> &emsp;&emsp;My name is Jesus Sarmiento, but most people call me Jesse which I prefer. Originally, I am 
        from Pharr, Texas, which is in an area of South Texas known as the Rio Grande Valley. <br><br>
        &emsp;&emsp;In Fall 2018, I was able to take my experiences growing up in a largely Hispanic and 
        bilingual environment to Texas A&M University, where I am now a Computer Science major in the 
        final year of a bachelorâ€™s degree program. I have also obtained an associate degree of science 
        in mathematics from South Texas College. In addition to my education, I have some technical 
        experience which includes a summer internship in the IT field and the completion of multiple 
        coding projects for my entertainment. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I am fascinated with solving problems, and 
        coding is a great tool to accomplish that. Whether it is data science, game development, or 
        artificial intelligence, I am always eager to learn new things and how to apply that knowledge 
        to the world. My strive for learning has given me a wide range of understanding and the ability 
        to help others solve problems with coding. One simple example is helping fellow classmates, who 
        are not experienced in coding, solve or visualize math and physics types of homework using 
        coding. Another example is helping a real estate agent I met with to find properties at 
        discounted rates efficiently. This is done by web scraping data from county records of sold 
        properties then using Python libraries to find trends in sellers, buyers, and locations. <br>
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;The world is always changing so I believe continuous learning through accepting new 
        challenges is the key to success in many aspects of my life including coding, fitness, and 
        relationships. With graduation approaching, I would love to join and contribute to a software 
        team to create products that enhance the lives of others. Feel free to contact me at
