    <p> 
      &emsp;&emsp;My name is Jesus Sarmiento, but most people call me Jesse which I prefer. Originally, I am from Pharr, Texas, which is in an area of South Texas known as the Rio Grande Valley. 
      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In Fall 2018, I was able to take my experiences growing up in a largely Hispanic and bilingual environment to Texas A&M University, where I am now a Computer Science major in the final year of a bachelorâ€™s degree program. I have also obtained an associate degree of science in mathematics from South Texas College. In addition to my education, I have some technical experience which includes a summer internship in the IT field and the completion of multiple individual and team coding projects. 
      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;I am fascinated with solving problems, and coding is a great tool to accomplish that. Whether it is data science, game development, or artificial intelligence, I am always eager to learn new things and how to apply that knowledge to the world. My strive for learning has given me a wide range of understanding and the ability to help others solve problems with coding.  
      <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;The world is always changing so I believe continuous learning through accepting new challenges is the key to success in many aspects of my life including coding, fitness, and relationships. With graduation approaching, I would love to join and contribute to a software team to create products that enhance the lives of others. Feel free to contact me at
