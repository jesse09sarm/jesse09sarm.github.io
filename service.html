    <p> &emsp;&emsp;I am from a largely Hispanic community in South Texas known as the Rio Grande Valley.
        Within my community, I have helped a financial advisor and a realtor using my knowledge of coding. 
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;For the financial advisor, I used 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation" target="_blank">RPA</a> software
        called 
        <a href="https://www.uipath.com/" target="_blank">UiPath</a> to automate the creation of csv files
        containing dozens of mutual funds daily prices spanning decades. Then the files were represented as 
        tables where the user can view the monthly or yearly percentage of returns. This program was valuable 
        to the financial advisor as he was able to compare performances of funds and to show the potential 
        return for future clients. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;For the realtor, I was asked to collect data from 
        <a href="https://hidalgo.tx.publicsearch.us/" target="_blank">county property records</a>. Using Python 
        libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping, I produced a csv file containing a table with 
        multiple features and thousands of rows. This was useful for the realtor to find patterns in when and 
        where certain entities are willing to buy or sell a property. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;These are small 
        contributions to a couple of members of my community but I received valuable practice applying my 
        abilities to improve the lives of those in my community. I would like to continue expanding my impact 
        on the community and any other community using the skills I have developed through coding.</p>
